# Guess A Number

This Python script is a simple number guessing game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. After each guess, the script provides feedback on whether the guess was too low or too high, helping the player to narrow down the correct answer. Once the player guesses the correct number, they win the game.

## How to Play

Follow the prompts to guess a number between 1 and the specified range.

## Code Overview

The Python script consists of the following components:

- The `guess()` function, which takes an integer `x` as input and generates a random number between 1 and `x`.
- A `while` loop that continues until the player guesses the correct number.
- Conditional statements to provide feedback on whether the guess is too low or too high.
- The script terminates when the player guesses the correct number.
